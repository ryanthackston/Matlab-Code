function varargout = Scroll_Demo(varargin)
%Scroll_Demo M-file for Scroll_Demo.fig
%      Scroll_Demo, by itself, creates a new Scroll_Demo or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = Scroll_Demo returns the handle to a new Scroll_Demo or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      Scroll_Demo('Property','Value',...) creates a new Scroll_Demo using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to Scroll_Demo_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      Scroll_Demo('CALLBACK') and Scroll_Demo('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in Scroll_Demo.M with the given input
%      arguments.

%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
